1. Do whatever THE FUCK you want with the original work, just don't be a dick. Oh and make it open source.

   Being a dick includes - but is not limited to - the following instances:

 1a. Outright copyright infringement - Don't just copy this and change the name.
 1b. Selling the unmodified original with no work done what-so-ever, that's REALLY being a dick.
 1c. Modifying the original work to contain hidden harmful content. That would make you a PROPER dick.
 1d. Stealing code with no proper credit - Ok now you're just dumb.

2. If you become rich through modifications (ad revenue is not accepted), related works/services, or supporting the original work,
share the love. Only a dick would make loads off this work and not buy the original work's
creator(s) a pint.

3. Code is provided with no warranty. Using somebody else's code and bitching when it goes wrong makes
you a DONKEY dick. Fix the problem yourself. A non-dick would submit the fix back. Also, GITHUB ISSUES EXIST YOU IDIOT.
